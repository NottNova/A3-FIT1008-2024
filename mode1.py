    Student- JOEL GEORGE
    This class initializes the Mode 1 Navigator with the given land sites and number of adventurers.
    For the sites - Lists were used as it is iterable and remains constant however the heap data structure was implemented to sort the data. With heaps a desired priority can be given to sort the elements and with retrieval can normally be at worst complexity of O(logn).
    for the sites_bst - binary search tree (BST)was used as the complexity to find an item is O(logn). This was preferred rather than a hash table as the complexity is lower, and we would also have to consider for O(hash) as well. Please note that a new method has been put into the heap file called is_empty to check whether the heap is empty. When testing for the testcases please use the heap fie that has been provided. Overall both the method of select_sites_from_adventure_numbers and update_site use the heap implemented sorted list while the update_site uses the BST to ensure that the site that we are trying to update indeed exists.
